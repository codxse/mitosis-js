# Project Instructions

## Package Manager

Prefer `pnpm` over `npm` or `npx`. Use `pnpm` for installing packages, running scripts, and all package management tasks.

## Workflow

- Use TDD: write tests first to validate behavior before implementing.
- Never auto-commit. Always ask before committing.
